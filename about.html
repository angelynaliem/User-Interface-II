    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I have been super blessed to be a full-time mom to my two little boys for the past four years. 
    Prior to becoming a mom, I served as Executive Director of a US State Department initiated not-for-profit organization in Indonesia that supports entrepreneurs. 
    It was at the organization that I became interested in the power of technology and hence, I wanted to learn how to code.
I usually code in the evenings after my children are in bed and my husband is around to take care of them in case they get up as they usually do.
Life as a mom and a student at a coding school is not easy, but so far it has been really fun and rewarding. 
I have a master's degree in social work/social enterprise administration from Columbia University. 
I also founded a social enterprise that helps people get the mental health support they need through lay counseling.
I enjoy traveling to new places and spending time with my family.</p>
